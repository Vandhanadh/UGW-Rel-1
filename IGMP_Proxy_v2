Objective:
Routed WAN with IGMPv2 WLAN 5G LAN clients and Bridged WAN with IGMPv3 WLAN 2.4G and LAN clients

Basic Configuration parameters:
WAN Mode =ETHWAN-Tagged
WAN Connection type =Bridge
LAN Interface Type =None
IP Version =IPv4
Config Interface =WEB

Test prerequisits:
DUT :
A.Load valid image and check whether DUT boots up. 

Test Procedure:
1. Enable IGMP proxy on the created WAN interface in the DUT and check at DUT's console for "mcastd" process.
2. Create WAN interface in bridge mode
3. Configure the AP (DUT) with SSID in 5G-11AN in WPA2 security on bridge (br-lan2)
4. Configure the AP (DUT) with SSID in 2.4G-11BGN in WPA2 security on default bridge (br-lan)
5. Start videos at two multicast servers.
6. Start VLC player on each LAN Host with source specifc multicast address with server address and check the multicast group entry was added into the "cat /proc/mcast-helper" and "ppacmd getmcgroups". 
7. Connect each WLAN client to the accordingly configured SSID and start video streaming for the specified mcast group
8. Capture the packets using wireshark at LAN host.

Pass/Fail Criteria:
1. WAN connection should be created successfully.
2. WAN connection should be created successfully.
3. Connection should appear and Ping should pass successfully.
4. Connection should appear and Ping should pass successfully.
5. Video should start successfully, mcastd process should be running.
6. LAN PC should get traffic from specified sources and entry should be added into the mcast-helper table and in the PPA table
7. WLAN client streaming should play only for specified mcast group not depends on LAN client streaming.
8. We should get IGMPv3 packets and continues UDP packets from both the sources with the multicast group address on which video is streaming
