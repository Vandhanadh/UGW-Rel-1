Objective:
Verify SW and HW snooping with one Wifi and two ETHLAN Clients in ETHWAN-Tagged mode

Basic Configuration parameters:
WAN Mode =ETHWAN-Tagged
WAN Connection type =PPPoE
LAN Interface Type =none
IP Version =IPv4
Config Interface =WEB

Test prerequisits:
DUT : 
A.Load valid image and check whether DUT boots up. 

Test Procedure:
1. WAN connection creation through WEB
A.Select Mode as ETH and configure VLAN with specific VLAN ID 
B.Configure Connection type as PPPoE with username and password as "qateam" with default gateway 
2. Wan_Connection_Check:
A. Check the WAN status through web page.
B. Check the connectivity between LAN host and WAN host using PING 
3. Enable IGMP proxy and snooping on DUT and check at DUT's console for "mcastd" process.
4.Configure the DUT with SSID in 2.4G - 11BGN with channel 6 in open security.
5. Scan and associate to Main AP's SSID from WIFI client.
6.Start VLC player at WiFi client and ETH LAN PC1 with multicast address (HD video is already running at server) and check the multicast group entry was added into the "cat /proc/mcast-helper" and "ppacmd getmcgroups".
7. Capture packets at ETH LAN PC2.

Pass/Fail Criteria:
Step 1: WAN connection should be created successfully.
Step 2: Connection should show and Ping should be succeded.
Step 3: mcastd process should be running.
Step 4: DUT should allow to configure.
Step 5: Connection should get established.
Step 6:Video must be playing at WiFi client1 and ETH LAN PC1 and both clients entry should be added in both the tables
Step 7: IGMP packets should not get at ETH LAN PC2.
